# IoT Building Blocks and Communication

## Smart Objects in IoT

Smart objects are key components in IoT implementations, consisting of:

- **Processing Unit**: Microcontroller for data processing
- **Communication Device**: For network connectivity
- **Power Source**: Often battery-powered with efficiency focus

## Communication Aspects

### Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs)

- **Advantages:**
  - Flexible deployments
  - Scalable architecture
  - Lower implementation costs
  - Easy device addition
  - Dynamic topology support
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Lower transmission speeds
  - Environmental interference impacts

### Communication Patterns

- **Event-Driven**: Data transmission on event detection
- **Periodic**: Regular interval transmission
