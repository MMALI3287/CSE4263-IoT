# Introduction to IoT

The basic premise of IoT is to "connect the unconnected" – linking objects not yet on a network so they can interact with people and each other.  
Instead of a single technology, IoT is an umbrella of various concepts, protocols, and technologies that present new challenges.

## Genesis of IoT

The IoT era is commonly dated to 2008–2009. Kevin Ashton, while at Procter & Gamble in 1999, coined the term "Internet of Things" to describe linking the company’s supply chain to the Internet.

> "In the twentieth century, computers were brains without senses—they only knew what we told them."  
> In the twenty-first century, computers are sensing things for themselves.²

## IoT and Digitization

- **Digitization** is the conversion of information into a digital format.
- It drives changes in product display, advertising, and retail operations.
- In IoT, it connects things, data, and business processes, making networked connections more valuable.

## Connected Roadways

- Self-driving cars are moving from fantasy to reality (e.g., Google's self-driving car).
- IoT enables vehicles to exchange data bidirectionally with transportation systems.
- Key points:

  - Cars already include basic sensors.
  - New sensors and communication technologies let vehicles "talk" to each other, traffic signals, and more.
  - Benefits include improved safety, reduced travel delays, and enhanced response times for emergency services.
  - Concepts like Intersection Movement Assist (IMA) demonstrate how integrating IoT with traditional and autonomous vehicles opens up innovative roadway solutions.

- **Vehicle Tracking**: Tracks vehicle location for arrival notifications, theft prevention, and highway assistance.
- **Cargo Management**: Provides precise cargo positioning en route, enabling dispatch alerts and optimized routing.
- **Road Weather Communications**: Uses sensors and satellite data to warn vehicles of hazardous conditions.

## Data Management and Security

- **Data Handling**: The vast amounts of data from vehicles must be processed efficiently and in real time.
- **Security & Availability**: Data must be secured with proper authentication; any breach can impact entire systems.
- **Third-Party Usage**: Data from cars can be sold or shared for operational and commercial benefits.

## IT vs. OT

- **IT (Information Technology)**: Manages business systems like email, databases, and file services.
- **OT (Operational Technology)**: Oversees industrial equipment (factory machines, meters, SCADA systems) using dedicated networks.  
  Traditionally separate, these worlds are now converging as OT adopts IT protocols (e.g., IPv6).

## IoT Challenges

### Big Data and Data Analytics

- **Challenge**: Managing massive volumes of data from millions of devices.
- **Key Issues**:
  - Processing a deluge of diverse data formats in real time.
  - Extracting actionable insights efficiently.
- **Importance**: Drives better decision-making and operational improvements.
- **Learn More**: Refer to Chapter 7 for detailed discussions.

### Interoperability

- **Challenge**: Achieving seamless communication between varied IoT systems.
- **Key Issues**:
  - Multiple competing protocols and architectures.
  - A mix of proprietary solutions and open standards.
  - No single standard universally adopted.
- **Progress**: New standards are reducing compatibility issues.
