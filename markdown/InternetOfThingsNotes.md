2. **Understand the Layers:** Be comfortable with the different layers in IoT architectures (e.g., IoTWF 7-Layer Model, the simplified 3-layer stack, Purdue Model). Know the function of each layer and key technologies/protocols operating within them.

3. **Compare & Contrast:** Be ready to compare different technologies (e.g., CoAP vs. MQTT, LoRaWAN vs. NB-IoT, REP vs. MRP vs. DLR, different WSN protocols). Understand their trade-offs (range, power, bandwidth, cost, topology, security).

4. **Know the Challenges:** IoT faces unique challenges (scale, security, heterogeneity, constrained devices/networks, data volume, legacy systems). Understand these challenges and how different solutions attempt to address them.

5. **Link Theory to Practice:** Connect the foundational concepts to the industry use cases. How are specific protocols and architectures applied in Manufacturing, Utilities, Smart Cities, etc.?

6. **Review Diagrams:** Pay close attention to the diagrams in the book and slides (e.g., protocol stacks, architecture layers, network topologies, data flows). They often summarize complex information effectively.

7. **Conceptual Flow:** Follow the logical flow from physical devices to applications and analytics, understanding dependencies between layers.

8. **Real-World Application:** Relate theoretical knowledge to specific industry use cases.
