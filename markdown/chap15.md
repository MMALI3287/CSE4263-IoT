# Chapter 15: Public Safety

## Introduction

Public safety organizations aim to keep citizens, communities, and public spaces safe by improving response times, operational efficiency, and reducing costs. With the growing complexity of emergency response challenges and rising expectations, the demand for critical communications across voice, data, and video is increasing. In crisis situations, every second counts, and decisions must be made swiftly.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing public safety by enabling real-time information sharing and situational awareness. IoT connects physical objects to sense and communicate data, allowing users to take action based on intelligent insights. This chapter explores IoT's impact on public safety, focusing on law enforcement, firefighting, emergency medical services (EMS), and school buses.
