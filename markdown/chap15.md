# Chapter 15: Public Safety

## Introduction

Public safety organizations aim to keep citizens, communities, and public spaces safe by improving response times, operational efficiency, and reducing costs. With the growing complexity of emergency response challenges and rising expectations, the demand for critical communications across voice, data, and video is increasing. In crisis situations, every second counts, and decisions must be made swiftly.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing public safety by enabling real-time information sharing and situational awareness. IoT connects physical objects to sense and communicate data, allowing users to take action based on intelligent insights. This chapter explores IoT's impact on public safety, focusing on law enforcement, firefighting, emergency medical services (EMS), and school buses.

## Overview of Public Safety

### Key Needs

Public safety organizations rely on collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to enable effective operations. Cross-agency collaboration is essential for both routine and emergency events. IoT enhances situational awareness and response capabilities by providing:

- Real-time situational awareness.
- Intra-agency communication (voice, data, video).
- Data analytics and information sharing.
- Increased community engagement.

### Public Safety Objects

IoT applications for public safety include three types of smart objects:

1. **Objects Carried by First Responders**: Sensors for vital signs, environmental hazards, body cameras, and smartphones.
2. **Objects for Callers or Victims**: Panic buttons, health monitors, and automated emergency call systems.
3. **Environmental Objects**: Street cameras, traffic sensors, and environmental monitors.

IoT also facilitates real-time voice and video communication, enabling faster and more reliable information exchange.
