  Create flashcards for key acronyms and terms (e.g., CoAP, MQTT, IEC 61850, CPwE, IACS, etc.) to reinforce definitions and context.

- **Practical Examples:**  
  Relate each topic back to real-world scenarios discussed in class or found in case studies—connect theory with application.

- **Prioritize Topics:**  
  Focus on areas highlighted by your instructor. Review detailed differences between protocols, security strategies, and industry-specific architectures.

- **Rest and Manage Time:**  
  Ensure you are well-rested before the exam, and structure your study sessions to allow time for both review and practice questions.
