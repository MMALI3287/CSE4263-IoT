## Introduction to Connected Manufacturing

### Key Challenges

A survey of over 400 manufacturing leaders identified the following top challenges:

- Meeting customer delivery dates
- Responding to unforeseen events
- Cost of poor quality and scrap
- Energy and maintenance costs
- Downtime and labor costs
- Material costs and production planning
- Rapid production adjustments and new product introduction cycles

### Aging Infrastructure

- The average age of automation infrastructure in the U.S. is the highest since 1938.
- 75% of U.S. plants are over 20 years old.
- 90% of the 60 million machines in factories worldwide are not connected, with most being over 15 years old.

### IoT-Driven Technologies

- **Data-Driven Manufacturing**: Real-time quality control, improved equipment effectiveness, and reduced downtime.
- **OT and IT Convergence**: Unified operational and information technology infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective Connectivity**: Scaled, automated, and platform-based machine connectivity.
- **Machines as a Service (MaaS)**: Zero-touch deployment and remote monitoring.

### IoT Strategy for Connected Manufacturing

- **Software Ubiquity**: Transitioning physical controls to software for cost-effective management.
- **AI and Self-Diagnosis**: Machines self-diagnose and repair issues through software updates.
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Full visibility into KPIs across the plant floor, enterprise, and supply chain.

## Converged Factory Architecture

### CPwE Overview

The Converged Plantwide Ethernet (CPwE) reference model, co-developed by Cisco and Rockwell Automation, focuses on the transport of EtherNet/IP. Key components include:

- **Cell/Area Zone**: Contains IACS devices (Levels 0â€“2) like HMIs and controllers.
- **Industrial Zone**: Supports IP routing for Level 3 applications.
- **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**: Manages secure traffic flows between industrial and enterprise zones.

### Resilient Network Design

Key capabilities for resilient IACS networks:

- **Availability**: Redundant physical paths for critical operations.
- **Predictable Performance**: Reliable, real-time traffic requirements.
- **Fast Network Reconvergence**: Restoration times under 100 ms.
- **Industrial Protocol Support**: Compatibility with industrial application protocols.

### Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP)

- Achieves sub-50 ms convergence times in ring topologies.
- Supports unlimited nodes per segment, unlike traditional STP.
- Utilizes a master node for segment control and failure notifications.

## Connected Factory Security

### Holistic Security Approach

A "defense-in-depth" strategy addresses internal and external threats with multiple layers of defense:

- **Control System Engineers**: Device hardening, network segmentation, and application authentication.
- **IT Collaboration**: Zone-based firewalls and policy-driven access control.

### Industrial DMZ

The IDMZ enforces data security policies between trusted (industrial) and untrusted (enterprise) networks. Key principles:

- All IACS traffic terminates in the IDMZ.
- Centralized policy for network access.
- Streamlined device onboarding and guest portal services.

## Edge Computing in the Connected Factory

### Challenges with Traditional Approaches

- PCs on the plant floor require frequent maintenance and are prone to hardware failures.
- Difficulties in aggregating and analyzing data effectively.

### Edge Computing Solutions

- **Ruggedized Edge Appliances**: Combine switching, routing, and security features.
- **Standard Protocols**: Support for MTConnect, OPC UA, and PackML.
- **Streaming Analytics**: Refines data on the plant floor before transmitting to the cloud.

### Business Benefits

- Reduced costs for secure machine data collection.
- Optimized network resources and bandwidth.
- Enhanced visibility and actionable insights through OEE analytics tools.
