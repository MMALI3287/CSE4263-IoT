## 2. Core IoT Concepts

### **Definition of IoT**

- IoT refers to the interconnection of physical objects ("things") embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to exchange data and perform actions without human intervention.

### **Key Drivers of IoT**

1. **Scale:** Billions of devices require scalable addressing (e.g., IPv6).
2. **Constrained Devices:** Limited power, processing, and memory.
3. **Data Explosion:** Massive data volumes require distributed processing.
4. **Legacy Systems:** Integration of older, non-IP protocols.
5. **Security Challenges:** Expanded attack surface and privacy concerns.

### **IT vs. OT Convergence**

- **IT (Information Technology):** Focuses on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
- **OT (Operational Technology):** Prioritizes availability, integrity, and safety (AIC).
- **Challenges:** Differing priorities, update cycles, and security practices.
