## I. Introduction & Purpose

This guide synthesizes the key concepts from the "IoT Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things" textbook and the supplementary slide materials provided. Its purpose is to structure your revision, highlight critical areas, and provide a comprehensive overview for exam preparation.

## II. Overall Exam Strategy

1. **Focus on Concepts:** Don't just memorize terms. Understand the _why_ behind different architectures, protocols, and design choices (e.g., Why use CoAP instead of HTTP in constrained environments? Why is IT/OT convergence challenging?).
2. **Understand the Layers:** Be comfortable with the different layers in IoT architectures (e.g., IoTWF 7-Layer Model, the simplified 3-layer stack, Purdue Model). Know the function of each layer and key technologies/protocols operating within them.
3. **Compare and Contrast:** Be ready to compare different technologies (e.g., CoAP vs. MQTT, LoRaWAN vs. NB-IoT, REP vs. MRP vs. DLR, different WSN protocols). Understand their trade-offs (range, power, bandwidth, cost, topology, security).
4. **Know the Challenges:** IoT faces unique challenges (scale, security, heterogeneity, constrained devices/networks, data volume, legacy systems). Understand these challenges and how different solutions attempt to address them.
5. **Link Theory to Practice:** Connect the foundational concepts (Parts I & II of the book) to the industry use cases (Part III). How are specific protocols and architectures applied in Manufacturing, Utilities, Smart Cities, etc.?
6. **Review Diagrams:** Pay close attention to the diagrams in the book and slides (e.g., protocol stacks, architecture layers, network topologies, data flows). They often summarize complex information effectively.
